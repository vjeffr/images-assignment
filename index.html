<p>

  An Upper East Side Coptic congregation is celebrating one year in their E. 62nd St. church, but members of the Roman Catholic parish that previously occupied the building continue to visit its stoop nightly, holding rosary vigils to pray for the reopening of their former spiritual home.

</p>

<p>

The Archdiocese of New York closed Our Lady of Peace in 2015, merging it with another parish seven blocks south.

</p>

<p>
Soon after the merger, Cardinal Timothy Dolan offered the space to Father Gregory Saroufeem, the priest for a community of Egyptian Christians, then known as St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church.
</p>

<p>
  The Coptic Orthodox faith is one of the oldest Christian rites, tracing its origin to 43 A.D. when the apostle Mark - a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth - is said to have founded Egypt's first church.

  Father Saroufeem, a Queens native of Egyptian descent, says most of parishioners come from Arabic-speaking Egyptian homes, but are more comfortable worshipping in English.

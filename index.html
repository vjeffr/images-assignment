<p>

An Upper East Side Coptic congregation is celebrating one year in their E. 62nd St. church, but members of the Roman Catholic parish that previously occupied the building continue to visit its stoop nightly, holding rosary vigils to pray for the reopening of their former spiritual home.
</p>

<p>

The Archdiocese of New York closed Our Lady of Peace in 2015 in part of the biggest reorganization in the diocese's 200 year history. While the parishioners were reassigned to another Catholic church only seven blocks south, the close knit group says their parish was unfairly targeted by the diocese for closure.

<p>
The group decided appeal the decision made by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, including filing a legal appeal with the Vatican, which has its own court system for adjudicating church matters.
</p>

<p>
  But the departure of Our Lady of Peace was a blessing for another group of worshippers in need.
</p>

<p>
About a year after the merger, Cardinal Dolan agreed to lease the building to a community of Egyptian Christians, led by Father Gregory Saroufeem.
</p>


<p>
Founded in 1999 as St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church, they changed their name to St. Mary and St. Mark when they moved into the former Our Lady Peace building. Until 2017, growing group held services in temporary spaces such as members homes and other churches' basements.

</p>

According to reporting by the New York Times, Pope Francis I was personally thrilled when he learned that the former Catholic church would now be a home for Egyptian-American Christians.
</p>

<p>
  "Historically, this is the first parish in the area founded by the children and grandchildren of immigrants," said Saroufeem explaining the unique cultural space St. Mark and St. Mary.

<p>
  Unlike many Coptic churches, St. Mary and St. Mark's liturgical language is English. Father Saroufeem, who was born in Egypt but moved to Queens at the age of four, says most of his parishioners come from Arabic-speaking homes, but are more comfortable worshipping in English.
</p>

<p>
  A few of the prayers recited during services are in Arabic or Greek. The parish utilizes an app in order to help the monolingual parishioners take part. It displays the scriptural readings as well as the call and response portions in English, Greek and Arabic on a large flat-screen television in real time.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, the members of the former Our Lady of Peace continue to wait on the results of their appeal, a process which can take years.
